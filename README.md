# cuda-bitcoin-address-lab
CUDA Bitcoin Address Lab A research-oriented toolkit for exploring Bitcoin address generation and cryptographic key space analysis, accelerated by NVIDIA CUDA.
🚀 Features
CUDA-Optimized Address Generation: Massively parallel generation of Bitcoin addresses (P2PKH, P2SH, Bech32) using GPU-accelerated SHA-256/RIPEMD-160.

Vanity Address Search: Custom pattern matching (e.g., prefix/suffix) for personalized Bitcoin addresses.

Performance Benchmarking: Compare GPU vs CPU throughput for cryptographic operations.

Educational Tool: Visualize Bitcoin keyspace entropy and collision probability models.

⚙️ Use Cases
Cryptography Research: Study Bitcoin's ECDSA/secp256k1 key derivation mechanics.

GPU Programming Practice: Learn CUDA optimization techniques for real-world hash workloads.

Wallet Developers: Test address generation edge cases and performance limits.

Blockchain Educators: Demonstrate Bitcoin's security assumptions in classroom settings.

⚠️ Legal & Ethical Notice
This project is strictly for educational and research purposes.

❌ Not designed for brute-force attacks – Bitcoin's keyspace (2²⁵⁶) makes such attempts infeasible.

🔒 Do not use with real funds – All generated keys/addresses should be on testnet or isolated environments.

📜 Users must comply with local laws and GitHub Acceptable Use Policies.

🛠️ Tech Stack
CUDA C++: Core GPU acceleration logic.

Python Bindings: User-friendly API for scripting (via PyCUDA).

Testnet Integration: Safe experimentation with bitcoin-cli testnet nodes.

Docker Support: Preconfigured environment for reproducibility.
